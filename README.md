# RISCV_SINGLE_CYCLE-RV32I
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V Single Cycle Processor (RV32I subset) using SystemVerilog.

It includes a fully functional datapath and control unit supporting basic instruction types: R-type, I-type, S-type, and SB-type. 

The processor follows a single-cycle architecture, meaning each instruction completes in exactly one clock cycle, regardless of complexity.
